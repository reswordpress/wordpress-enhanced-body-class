## About This Plugin

This plugin was created by Noah J. Stewart in response to a specific problem. In January 2019, 
Noah Stewart was contacted by his father regarding a WordPress plugin that his astronomy club 
was using. They were having trouble customizing a few of the role-based options in a popular 
gallery plugin. The simplest approach to the problem was to use css to selectively hide 
certain elements for users with the **author** role that should be visible to users with the 
**administrator** role.
